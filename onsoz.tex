Firstly, I would like to thank to my supervisor Prof. Dr. Sema Fatma OKTU\u{G} for all of
her support and guidance during my M.Sc. thesis.

I appreciate support of the Turkish Ministry of Development and Istanbul Technical University researcher support program under the Grant No. ITU-AYP-2017-1.

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to my family for their continuous support
through all my life.
