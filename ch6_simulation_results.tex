For simulation results in this thesis, global simulation parameters are set as follows: packet size is set to 60 Bytes, simulation duration is set to 3600 seconds and traffic generation type is set as Poisson. First, single gateway and multiple gateway LoRaWAN network simulation results are presented to show correctness of the simulator. Then, smart spreading factor scheme simulation results are presented.

\section{Single Gateway}

In Figure \ref{fig:sf}, PDR and transmit energy consumption plots of various spreading factor assignment schemes are shown. Randomly generated network topology radius is set to 3000 meters, number of gateways is set to 1 and packet generation rate is set to 0.01 pps. Increasing spreading factors increases air time. This increases the number of collisions thus decreases the PDR. Also, increasing spreading factors increases total transmit energy consumption as expected. High spreading factor schemes gives poor PDR results as the number of nodes increases. Since network topology radius is quite small, all spreading factors can reach to gateway.

\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:r}, PDR and transmit energy consumption plots of various network radii are shown. Number of gateways is set to 1, lowest spreading factor assignment scheme is used and packet generation rate is set to 0.01 pps. Increasing network radius, increases the number of under sensitivity transmissions thus decreases the PDR of network. Nodes select higher spreading factors when they are far away from the gateway. Thus, higher spreading factor leads to longer air time, higher number of collisions and higher total transmit power consumption.

\par In Figure \ref{fig:pr}, PDR and transmit energy consumption plots of various packet generation rate are shown. Randomly generated topology radius is set to 3000 meters, number of gateways is set to 1 and lowest spreading factor assignment scheme is used. Increasing packet generation rate, increases air time thus increases number of collisions, decreases PDR of the network and increases transmit power consumption. Doubling packet generation rate doubles total transmit power consumption.

\end{figure}

\section{Multiple Gateway}

In Figure \ref{fig:gw}, PDR and transmit energy consumption plots for various number of gateways are shown. Randomly generated topology radius is set to 3000 meters, the lowest spreading factor assignment scheme is used and packet generation rate is set to 0.01 pps. Increasing number of gateways in constant network topology radius, decreases the distance between nodes and gateways. Thus, decreases the number of collisions at receivers (gateways). Hence, increases the PDR of network. Since topology radius is too small, most of the end nodes selects lowest spreading factor all the time. Thus air time is same and total transmit power consumption is same for all plots.

\section{Smart Spreading Factor Schemes} 

PDR and transmit energy plots of the lowest spreading factor, random spreading factor and the smart prediction schemes are shown in Figure \ref{fig:prediction}. Randomly generated network radius is set to 5000 meters, number of gateways is set to 3 and packet generation rate is set to 0.01 pps. Prediction model needs nodes' locations and three gateways are enough to locate position of nodes by triangulation. In Table \ref{table:prediction_pdr}, PDR values for various network radii are presented. Both smart SVM and smart DTC schemes give better PDR than lowest spreading factor schemes when number of nodes increases. Increasing number of nodes, increases number of interferences. Smart schemes improve network performance when LoRa interference is high. Moreover, smart schemes give better results when nodes are deployed closer to the gateway, since nodes have margin to increase their spreading factors when they are deployed closer to the gateway. If a node is far away from gateway, then smart schemes cannot increase the spreading factor to avoid interference since the assigned spreading factor is already high. As number of nodes increases, both smart SVM and smart DTC schemes consume slightly more energy than lowest SF scheme, however they give better PDR results in return. Random spreading factor scheme consumes much more higher transmit power than the rest.

In Table \ref{table:prediction_accuracy}, prediction accuracy of smart SVM and smart DTC schemes are presented for various network radii and number of nodes. Prediction accuracy is not directly proportional to network PDR. Correct prediction of an interfered transmission may not increase the PDR but increases the prediction accuracy. Smart DTC gives better network PDR results than smart SVM, even overall smart SVM prediction accuracy is higher. The distribution of different labeled data points in the dataset is strongly related to simulation parameters. If simulation is run with small topology radius and high number of nodes, then number of interfered transmission labeled data points increases. On the other hand, using a large topology radius in the simulation causes the number of under sensitivity transmission labeled data points to increase. Moderately dense network parameters are chosen to make it closer to real world deployments. With the simulation parameters utilized in this section, simulation tool usually produces imbalanced dataset. Number of under sensitivity transmission labeled data points are less than number of successful transmission labeled data points. Besides, number of interfered transmission labeled data points are even less than number of under sensitivity transmission labeled data points. In this case, smart DTC predicts interfered transmission labeled data points more accurately. Correct classification of interfered transmissions yields better network PDR results, thus smart DTC scheme gives better network PDR results.
